## What is CHAMP

CHAMP risk calculator is a tool which utilizes the algorithm introduced
in X

## Usage

In short, the tool can be used to either calculate the risk of 30
mortality for one patient using the *Single patient*-tab or for multiple
patients using the *Multiple patients*-tab. The former can be directly
given the values of the variables whereas the latter requires both the
variable definitions excel table and the data as an excel table or csv
file.

### Single patient -tab

The *Single patient*-tab requires the user to manually input the values.

### Multiple patients -tab

The *Tables*-tab uses the *variable_definitions.xlsx* to read the given
data and wrangle it for the tool. The risk can then be calculated and
the given data can be downloaded with the additional risk-column
included.
